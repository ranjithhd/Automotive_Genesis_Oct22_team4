### Brake by wire - Market analysis

### Global Brake-by-Wire System Market: Overview
Brake-by-wire system refers to a technology that replaces the mechanical and hydraulic elements of traditional brake systems with sensors and electronic actuators to bring in better braking system in automobiles. This comparatively new system is more accurate and much better when it comes to effectiveness, system design, and braking efficiency. Such benefits of the system are likely to trigger growth of the global brake-by-wire system market over the timeframe of analysis, from 2020 to 2030.

Brake-by-wire system finds utilization is a wide variety of vehicles, comprising commercial and passenger vehicles. It is also utilized in many heavy-duty commercial vehicles and in those vehicles these are called electronic braking system. Makers of this type of braking system are now increasingly focusing on the development of advanced brake technology for this system. Hybrid cars and electric cars are also generating demand for brake-by-wire system. These factors are likely to work in favor of the global brake-by-wire system market in the years to come.

The global brake-by-wire system market has been segmented on the basis of three important parameters, which are type, sales channels, and region.

### Global Brake-by-Wire System Market: Key Trends

The global brake-by-wire system market is characterized by the presence of the following restraints, drivers, and opportunities.

Demand to Ride High on the Back of Increased Adoption of Electric and Hybrid Vehicles

In comparison with the conventional braking system, brake-by-wire system comes with more effectiveness and braking efficiency. Manufacturers are coming up with various electronic components and sub-systems of this brake-by-wire technology, such as control unit for accurate analysis of vehicle data, sensors, and actuators. In addition, this system also enables collection of vehicle data from various sensors within the vehicle and thus helps the brake-by-wire system to react fast and diminish the stopping distance. These advantages of the system is expected to bolster growth of the global brake-by-wire system market over the timeframe of assessment, from 2020 to 2030.

The brake-by-wire system has been witnessing a rise in the demand from electric and hybrid vehicles. In addition, this braking technology is also commonly found in the form of an electric park brake, which is extensively utilized in the mainstream automobiles. Several automotive companies are making use of electric park brake on a large scale in their electric cars, which is likely to play an important role in the development of the global brake-by-wire system market over the tenure of analysis, from 2020 to 2030.

### Global Brake-by-Wire System Market: Geographical Analysis

North America is prophesized to account for a sizeable chunk of global brake-by-wire system market.

### Brake by wire system - Research 

The automobile brake-by-wire (BBW) system, which is also called the electromechanical brake system, has become a promising vehicle braking control scheme that enables many new driver interfaces and enhanced performances without a mechanical or hydraulic backup. In this paper, we survey BBW control systems with focuses on fault tolerance design and vehicle braking control schemes. At first, the system architecture of BBW systems is described. Fault tolerance design is then discussed to meet the high requirements of reliability and safety of BBW systems. A widely used braking model and several braking control schemes are investigated. Although previous work focused on antilock and antislip braking controls on a single wheel basis, we present a whole-vehicle control scheme to enhance vehicle stability and safety. Simulations based on the whole-vehicle braking model validate a proposed fuzzy logic control scheme in the lateral and yaw stability controls of vehicles.
